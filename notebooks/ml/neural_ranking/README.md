StarSpace is an open source machine learning library developed by FaceBook Research.
In this notebook we briefly walkthrough its remarkably simple yet powerful idea on how to use neural embeddings to solve a variety of different problems,
all fit into a unified ranking framework.
And we will use Quora Duplicated Question Pairs dataset as a working demo to do some exercises with both the StarSpace library and one of its R wrapper called ruimtehol.
