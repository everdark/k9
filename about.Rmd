My definition of a **Data Scientist**:

> A *software developer* specializing in data science application.

And, yes, I'm a data scientist. :)

I use data to solve problems. For the past decade I've worked in E-commerce, cyber security, and banking indsutry.

WHENEVER THERE IS DATA, THERE IS A WAY.
